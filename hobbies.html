                    <h2>A glimpse into the process</h2>
                    <div class="section1">
                    <p>I conducted an interview with the subject involving a series of questions ranging from their day-to-day life, career accomplishments, endeavors, mission statement, and personal interests. I was able to gather helpful information throughout the interview itself, however, I needed more material to gain a better insight into some of the topics that were discussed. For example, the subject expressed her love for travel and highlighted South Africa, Cape Town and the country of Morocco. I then researched travel advisories, destinations, tourist attractions, room and board expenses, cultural differences, and general expectations when traveling to those locations.

                    <div class="section2">
                    <p>Next, I wanted to collect more information on her job description and the services that the business provides. I researched chimney sweeping services and specifically observed her website, taking note of the work that they offered. I was able to collect customer reviews and ratings of the company as well as awards the business received. I discussed with the subject how she got involved in chimney maintenance and how long its been up and running.

                    <div class="section3">
                    <p>One of last questions I asked in the interview was where she sees herself in five years. She mentioned she will be starting classes to acquire a real estate license in a month. She expressed her love for homes and interior design. In turn I inquired online about the role and tasks of a real-estate agent. I also explored information pertaining to interior design. Outside of the interview, she gave me a brief timeline overview to help me when writing out the bio.

                    <p>I also spoke with her husband and a close friend of hers to gain an alternative perspective. I'm really glad I decided to take this approach because it offered two unique point of views on the subject. One side being from a person who knows her at an intimate level, and the other side being from a person who knows her as a deep life long friend.
